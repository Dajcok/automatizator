# For stargazers
Thank you all for starring this repository! It’s exciting to see your interest, so I wanted to share an update on the project's current status. We're still in the early stages of development, and unfortunately, I can only dedicate a few hours each week to work on it. Because of this, there’s no comprehensive documentation yet, and the setup or contribution process might not be immediately clear.

However, once the repository reaches at least 50 stars, I’ll prioritize adding proper documentation, better examples, and more detailed information about the project. If you’d like to dive in sooner and experiment with the project, feel free to send me a DM—I'd be happy to help!
